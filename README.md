# ngvizApiDemonstrator
As simple as possible an ngviz that demonstrates writing an ngviz against the API, without delving into all the different control types.

This package should be built using the [common instructions](https://github.com/Displayr/ngviz/blob/master/docs/Common%20instructions%20for%20building%20visualizations.md).
